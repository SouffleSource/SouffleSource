# 👋 Hello, Cybersecurity Community!

I'm a cybersecurity engineer specialising in **threat-informed defense** with expertise across design, architecture, and engineering.

## 🛡️ About Me
- 🧠 Leveraging offensive knowledge to build stronger defensive capabilities
- 🔍 Focused on threat prevention and detection engineering
- 🌱 Currently exploring identity security in depth
- 👨‍💻 Proficient in Python, PowerShell, and API integrations
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on security projects related to threat detection, security posture assessment, and automation


## 💡 My Approach to Security
I believe in a threat-informed defense approach that bridges the gap between offensive knowledge and defensive implementation. My work focuses on creating practical tools that security teams can use to enhance their security posture, automate repetitive tasks, and gain better visibility into potential threats.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!
I'm interested in collaborating on open-source security projects related to:
- Threat detection and response automation
- Identity security and access management
